This project demonstrates a fully functional Banking System Database built using MySQL, with a strong focus on ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
It includes complete SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting sample data, and executing real banking transactions such as money transfers.

🔹 Features

- Structured database design (Customer, Account, TransactionLog)

- 6 dummy customer entries with realistic account data

- Safe money transfer operation using SQL transactions

- Full demonstration of ACID properties:

- Atomicity: All-or-nothing updates

- Consistency: Valid state enforced

- Isolation: Concurrent transaction safety

- Durability: Changes persist after commit

- Clear and documented SQL code for learning & reference

🔹 What’s Included

- CREATE statements for all required tables

- INSERT statements with 6 customer records

- Transaction scripts using:

- START TRANSACTION

- COMMIT
